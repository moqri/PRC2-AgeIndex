# PRC2-AgeIndex Example

### This example of the PRC2-AgeIndex recreates Figure 6b of the manuscript. 

To run this example,  clone the “PRC2AgeIndex_User_Friendly_Example” folder and download NEO.meth.p2.bw p5, p8, as well as NEO.hmr  from GSE253985, to “data/meth/NeoFib” folder. Two public PRC2 ChIP bw files also need to be downloaded to the data/chip folder (see Neo_Fibro_ExampleLMR.ipynb for links). Then run “Neo_Fibro_ExampleLMR.ipynb” to generate neonatal LMRs ordered by PRC2 binding, as well as PRC2-AgeIndex plots. 

This PRC2-AgeIndex example take place after generation of bigwig files from methylation count data.  See “PRC2-AgeIndex_Manuscript_Figures/LMR_generation_DNMTools.sh” to see generation of bigwigs from DNMTools/Abismal mapped data. Alternatively, bedgraph files generated by bismark (specifically bismark2bedGraph) can be converted to bigwig files with ucsc_tools:

_bedGraphToBigWig $bedfile $chromosome_sizes ${out}.bw_

To run for other tissues (see PRC2-AgeIndex_Manuscript_Figures/results), download and move to meth folders, adjust names and run code in similar manner to the Neo example presented here.
