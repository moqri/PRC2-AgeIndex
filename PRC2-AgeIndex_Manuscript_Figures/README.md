MS Figure Generation 

1.	WGBS_Mapping.sh - Mapping was ran on downloaded samples (see Supp.Table 1 in manuscript). DNMTools/Methpipe was ran to generate percentage methylation files (.meth files) used for the following analysis. Users who want the .meth files generated from online datasets can send a request to moqri@stanford.edu or dsimps93@stanford.edu. Meth files generated from fibroblast samples in our study can be downloaded from GSE253985.

2.	LMR_Generation_DNMTools.sh - LMR generation using .meth files to generate a list of low methylated regions for each given tissue type.

3.	Generate binding per LMR per sample

4.	Run to generate plots and results for manuscript.

5.	Run to generate supplementary figures and analysis of LMR regions.
